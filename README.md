This Clock allows the user to study using the Pomodoro Technique where one would study for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break to maintain a healthy working flow.
Custom times are also available, up to 60 minutes for both the study and break session.

I made this project to improve my front end skills and to further my understanding of React by touching on concepts such as:
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect and useRef) 
- Functional Updates Pattern 
- Batch Processing
- Asynchronous Functions
- React Functional Components & Props
- Arrow functions
- JSX Components
